Fuel Consumption,"City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km) - combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per imperial gallon (mpg)",,,,,,,,,,
CO2 Emissions (g/km),Estimated tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions (in grams per kilometre) are based on fuel type and the combined fuel consumption rating.,,,,,,,,,,
